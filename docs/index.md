## Abstract
Legged locomotion is arguably the most suited and
versatile mode to deal with natural or unstructured terrains.
Intensive research into dynamic walking and running con-
trollers has recently yielded great advances, both in the optimal
control and reinforcement learning (RL) literature. Hopping is
a challenging dynamic task involving a flight phase and has
the potential to increase the traversability of legged robots.
Model based control for hopping typically relies on accurate
detection of different jump phases, such as lift-off or touch
down, and using different controllers for each phase. In this
paper, we present a end-to-end RL based torque controller that
learns to implicitly detect the relevant jump phases, removing
the need to provide manual heuristics for state detection. We
also extend a method for simulation to reality transfer of
the learned controller to contact rich dynamic tasks, resulting
in successful deployment on the robot after training without
parameter tuning.
